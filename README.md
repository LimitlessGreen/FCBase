# FCBase
An open, community-maintained database of flight controllers for ArduPilot, PX4, and iNAV â€“ searchable, comparable, and fully documented.

## Hardware Openness Metadata

Each controller entry records a `hardware.openness` flag (`open`, `closed`, or `mixed`) sourced from the ArduPilot Autopilot Hardware guide. This highlights whether designs follow the open Pixhawk standard or are distributed as closed hardware.
